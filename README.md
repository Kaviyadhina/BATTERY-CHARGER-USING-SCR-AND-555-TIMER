# BATTERY-CHARGER-USING-SCR-AND-555-TIMER
This project designs a battery charger using an SCR and 555 timer to regulate charging safely and efficiently. The SCR controls current flow, while the 555 timer provides timing signals to prevent overcharging. The circuit ensures automatic charging, protects battery health, and supports reliable performance.
